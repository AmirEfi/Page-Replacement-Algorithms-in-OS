## Final Project of Operating Systems course - Fall 2022

This is my final project in OS course.

It's the FIFO, LRU and Second-Chance algorithms to manage incoming customers to a restaurant.

The customers have a unique number and the Server determines which customer has to go to inside the restaurant.
