# Page-Replacements-Algorithm-in-OS
## Final Project of Operating Systems course - Fall 2022

This is my final project in the OS course.

In this project, the FIFO, LRU, and Second-Chance algorithms manage incoming customers to a restaurant.

The customers have a unique number and the Server determines which customer has to go inside the restaurant, then based on algorithms, we have to manage them.
